Update reread the error.md file.

ok, so let's improve all the md. Check the current md files, and using only pdftotext or other tools, check if there's things to improve, make clearer, add missing context or information. do it all over for all files. another llm did this task, but feel free to edit and improve over it if you think you can make it better.

please read error.md file, to see where you're lacking in the convertion. assume the same kind of mistake are being made on all pdf to md convertion. Please recheck everything throuly this time,  and make sure every api, url and tag has the correct name. This is important. Good luck

also it seems those markdown file has been theme as a developer technical distilled version of the pdf. While i want a more portable, llm friendly version of these pdf. We don't need to be brief, or be agrresive cutting out content. If it helps undertanding all the concecpt is ok. But it should be thought as a "developer version" but as an "improversion" of these pdf. Everything should be in the md files. as the pdf will be archive and not referenced unless completely necesary. Also text is cheap, size wise, and token wise. No need to be stingy!

please check this generated file against the pdf. How does it look? is it complete? anything missing or that could be improved into? what do you think? (new version) (also this is just one, of various documents, as such, some reference will be missing) also make a patch file or something similar that would pinpoint where and what to change. note from previous fix:

New Update, reread the error.md file and patch file if it exists. And fix as you consider.

Remember these are the output of another llm, verify everything it says is true and it's no hallucinanting like a drug addict high on LSD, ok?

also check if there's a patch file in the fixes folder. it can help you see what the llm think you should change.

please check if you already extracted the text from the corresponding pdf. if not extract it to make sure everything pointed out on error.md is true BEFORE you change anything. If you haven't extracted the pdf, do it first and note where you put the file for futher loops.

**

okey, now we are going overdrive, plan, make and inmediatly execute, not need to ask me, a overhaul of every single pdf and it's md file counterpart, using all our tools available, using the export folder as our dump site for easy access, cross reference all tools to get as close as 1:1 possible to the pdf. Plan for multiple loops if need be, take as much time as need be, add all you do in a planning/task/wlaktrough file so you don't get lost. be as truthful as possible.
please remember you have to use all three available tools. Camelot pdfplumber and pdftotext. These pdf are plagued with tables. otherwise you will get lost. Please update your plan if you didn't take that into account.
please use the pipx version of the tools.
they are already installed using:

# Install Camelot CLI (Note the package name is camelot-py, NOT camelot)
pipx install "camelot-py[cv]"

# Install pdfplumber CLI
pipx install pdfplumber
good luck
