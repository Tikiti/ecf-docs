# General Law on Electronic Invoicing of the Dominican Republic
**Law No. 32-23**
**Official Gazette No. 11107 of May 17, 2023**

## THE NATIONAL CONGRESS
**In the Name of the Republic**

### Law No. 32-23

**First Consideration:** That the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, signed on June 28, 2016, constitutes part of the international cooperation processes for tax transparency and the fight against evasion, promoted by the Group of Twenty (G20) and led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); in that sense, the global effort against Money Laundering, Financing of Terrorism (ML/FT), and combating evasion and avoidance resulting from aggressive tax planning by large multinational companies is considered a priority, where States are required to implement tax transparency measures that clarify their market climate and allow "external" knowledge of financial flows;

**Second Consideration:** That the "Washington Consensus" is a set of recommendations aimed at the development of economic policies that emerged in the 1990s and are fostered by financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; in that sense, based on these economic policies, tax administrations have initiated the modernization of their processes with a macro-fiscal emphasis, fused with substantial aspects of "reinventing government," which imbues paradigms of efficiency in public administration service, making the administrative activity of collection compatible with systems that do not reduce fiscal control and risk perception;

**Third Consideration:** That Law No. 126-02, of September 4, 2002, on Electronic Commerce, Documents, and Digital Signatures, laid the foundations for the use of digital documents in the Dominican Republic, giving equal legal value to electronic modalities as to those of physical documents, which has allowed large Dominican businesses to use this modality as proof of their operations and transactions;

**Fourth Consideration:** That Law No. 11-92, of May 16, 1992, approving the Tax Code of the Dominican Republic, establishes the Tax Administration's authority to determine the form in which information and support documents will be received to facilitate the verification of tax obligations, as well as the mode and form of sworn declarations and their presentation, establishing from said provisions the foundations for the beginning of an Electronic Invoicing Fiscal System that is consistent with the principle of celerity established in Law No. 107-13, of August 6, 2013, on the Rights of Persons in their Relations with the Administration and of Administrative Procedure, which states: "Authorities shall officially promote procedures and encourage the use of information and communication technologies so that procedures are processed diligently and without unjustified delays, in writing or through electronic techniques and means";

**Fifth Consideration:** That the mandatory use of electronic invoicing implies significant advantages for taxpayers due to the reduction in the cost of compliance with tax obligations as a consequence of digitization and the reduction of business operating expenses;

**Sixth Consideration:** That with the entry into force of General Standard No. 01-2020, of January 9, 2020, issued by the Directorate General of Internal Taxes (DGII), the issuance and use of Electronic Fiscal Vouchers (e-CF) in the electronic invoicing process was regulated for the first time, paving the way for the implementation of a system that allows interconnection with taxpayers for the issuance and reception of electronic fiscal vouchers, serving as support for income, costs, and expenses for tax credit purposes;

**Seventh Consideration:** That the implementation of the Electronic Fiscal Voucher (e-CF) system in the electronic invoicing process allowed the Dominican Tax Administration to strengthen its technological capacity to face potential challenges of data storage, processing, and computation required to be maintained over time as a means of fiscal control, with a national fiscal system of electronic invoicing that is massified and generalized for all taxpayers in the country;

**Eighth Consideration:** That one of the most relevant aspects of innovation in the legal systems of the region has been the establishment of the massification of the use of electronic invoicing as a mandatory commercial modality, a modality that translates into an instrument of the third industrial revolution and document control, due to its capacity for generating and disseminating commercial data in real-time, price and transaction transparency, low environmental impact, market regulation, and fiscal effectiveness;

**Ninth Consideration:** That within the framework of international taxation, electronic invoicing facilitates the exchange of tax information and its development, as it is a tool that provides better knowledge of the tax subject in their domestic operations, providing almost complete information on the universe of taxpayers and transactions carried out;

**Tenth Consideration:** That the Dominican Republic has a solid telecommunications infrastructure available throughout the country; however, it is important to create contingency and exceptional conditions that allow the normal operation of markets and businesses that carry out commercial and financial transactions;

**Eleventh Consideration:** That it is in the interest of the Dominican State to improve the efficiency, productivity, and transparency of its markets and the Tax Administration, with the implementation of innovation measures, such as electronic invoicing, in order to continue fostering the social, industrial, and commercial development of the country and minimizing fiscal revenues.

**Article 20.- Response.** The response issued by the DGII regarding the validated e-CF, as established in Article 19, may be:

1) **Accepted:** Refers to the status of the e-CF when it meets requirements specified in the standard format, which, upon receipt by the DGII, is valid for fiscal purposes;

**Paragraph VI.-** validation by the DGII of the e-CF structure and acceptance or commercial rejection exercised by the receiver at no time limits or excludes the DGII's auditing powers regarding the parties' tax obligations.

## CHAPTER IV
### ON FISCAL FRAUD

**Paragraph II.-** The tax risk certification shall imply lifting the duty of reserve established in Law No. 11-92, of May 16, 1992, approving the Tax Code of the Dominican Republic, in order to strengthen Tax System transparency.
