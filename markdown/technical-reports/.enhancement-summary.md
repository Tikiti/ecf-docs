### 📊 Content Comparison

**Before Enhancement:**
- 273 lines
- Missing web services
- Missing workflows
- Missing implementation details  
- ~13 sections

**After Enhancement:**
- 514 lines
- ✅ Complete web service docs (11 services)
- ✅ Three operation models with step-by-step flows
- ✅ XML character escaping table
- ✅ Corrections/annulment business rules
- ✅ Field obligatoriness codes (0/1/2/3)
- ~18 sections

### 🔴 Remaining Minor Gap

**Print Section (Section 17):** Could still be enhanced with:
- Detailed header layout (top-right, top-left, bottom-left fields)
- Complete QR URL parameter lists
- Security code display specs

**Current State**: Has QR basics (22x22mm, 2cm edge, 3mm margin)  
**Needed**: Full header field list and complete QR URL examples

**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (specs exist in complete version, developers can reference)
