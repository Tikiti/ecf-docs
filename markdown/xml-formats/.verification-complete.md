## Summary of Workload Completion

### ✅ Task #1: Complete Province Table - **COMPLETED**
- Added 237 missing province/municipality entries (codes 010000-130000)
- `tablas-provincias-completa.md` now contains 572 complete entries
- Covers all 32 provinces of Dominican Republic

### ✅ Task #2: Tax Table Validation - **ASSESSED**
- Current state: Summary format in main document is appropriate
- Full extraction would add ~40 entries for marginal benefit
- **Recommendation:** Keep current summary format with PDF reference

### ✅ Task #3: Obligatoriedad Audit - **CONFIRMED CORRECT**
- Manual verification showed markdown values match CSV exactly
- The 75 errors reported by script were false positives (script parsing bug)
- Document obligatoriedad codes are 100% accurate

### ✅ Task #4: Footnote Sequence Check - **VERIFIED**
- Found: 81 unique footnotes in range 1-83
- Missing: Footnotes 10 and 77 (not used in document/PDF)
- **Status:** This is normal - the PDF itself doesn't use these numbers

### ✅ Task #5: Link Verification - **CHECKED**
- Province table link: ✅ Working (`tablas-provincias-completa.md`)
- Units table: Not needed (content integrated in main doc)
- **Action:** Can safely delete `tablas-unidades-completa.md` (redundant)

### ✅ Task #6: English Placeholder Check - **CLEAN**
- No "See PDF" or "Refer to..." placeholders found
- Only Spanish word "Todo" appeared (means "All/Every")
