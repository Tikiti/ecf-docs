I need to create a TRUE 1:1 Spanish representation from the PDF "Formato Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico (e-CF) V1.0.pdf" for the ecf-format-v1.0 documentation.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **DO NOT use** `markdown/xml-formats/ecf-format-v1.0.md` as a reference - ignore it completely
2. **DO NOT modify** the optimized version - leave it untouched
3. **USE ONLY** the PDF and the extracted data from camelot/pdfplumber

**Available Resources:**
- PDF extractions at: `/home/romulo/visual/ecf/ecf-docs/exports/Formato-Comprobante-Fiscal-Electronico-e-CF-V1.0_c811c9/`
- camelot lattice tables: `camelot/lattice/*.csv` (191 tables)
- pdfplumber tables: `pdfplumber/tables/*.csv`
- Workflow document: `markdown/xml-formats/.workflow-ecf-format-pdf-first.md`

**Task:**
Create `markdown/xml-formats/ecf-format-v1.0-original.md` as a **perfect 1:1 Spanish representation** of the PDF by:

1. **Start fresh** - Remove any existing `-original.md` and `-complete.md` files
2. **Read the workflow** at `.workflow-ecf-format-pdf-first.md`
3. **Extract tables** from camelot/pdfplumber CSV/JSON data
4. **Preserve exact PDF structure** - section organization, wording, footnotes
5. **Use verbatim Spanish** - exact field descriptions from PDF, no cleanup
6. **Include ALL footnotes** with original numbering from PDF
7. **Work page-by-page** through the PDF systematically

**Expected Output:**
- File: `markdown/xml-formats/ecf-format-v1.0-original.md`
- Format: Markdown with tables
- Content: 100% from PDF, 0% from optimized version
- Language: Spanish (exactly as in PDF)
- Length: Likely 1,100-1,200 lines (longer than optimized due to verbatim PDF content)

**Verification:**
- All field counts must match PDF tables exactly
- All Spanish text must be verbatim from PDF
- All footnotes must be included
- Structure must follow PDF page organization
- NO content borrowed from the optimized .md file

**Start by:**
1. Checking what camelot/pdfplumber data is available
2. Reading the workflow document
3. Extracting the cover page and version history table from PDF
4. Then proceed page-by-page building the document

Please begin by examining the available PDF extraction data and confirming your approach follows the PDF-first workflow.
