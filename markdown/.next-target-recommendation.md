## 🎯 TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS (In Priority Order)

### 🥇 **#1 RECOMMENDED: `ecf-format-v1.0.md`**

**Why this one?**

✅ **Most Critical Document**
- This is THE core XML specification for e-CF
- Contains ALL field definitions, data types, validations
- **993 lines** - substantial but manageable
- **Filled with tables** - perfect for camelot/pdfplumber verification

✅ **High Impact**
- Used by every developer implementing e-CF
- Source of truth for XML structure
- Referenced by all other format documents

✅ **Perfect Complexity Level**
- Not too big (like technical-description was)
- Not too small (like guides)
- Rich table content to leverage extraction tools

✅ **Natural Next Step**
- We've done the overview docs (technical-report, technical-description)
- We've done the visual guide (printed-representation)
- **Now we need the data spec** (ecf-format)

**Estimated Effort**: 
- PDF extract check: 30 min
- Spanish original: 2-3 hours (many tables)
- English translation: 2-3 hours
- Cross-check: 1 hour
- **Total: 5-7 hours**

---

### 🥈 **#2 Alternative: `digital-signing-guide.md`**

**Why this one?**

✅ **Critical Implementation Topic**
- Every developer MUST implement signing correctly
- Contains code examples (C#, VB.NET, Java, PHP)
- Technical but practical

✅ **Moderate Size** (337 lines)
- Manageable in one session
- Rich technical content

⚠️ **However**:
- More guide-like (less structured than specs)
- May have fewer tables to verify
- Implementation-focused vs specification-focused

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours total

---

### 🥉 **#3 Alternative: `rfce-format-v1.0.md`**

**Why this one?**

✅ **Important Subset**
- Consumer invoice summary format
- Used for high-volume retail
- Smaller scope (234 lines)

✅ **Quick Win**
- Could complete in 2-3 hours
- Build momentum

⚠️ **However**:
- Less comprehensive than ecf-format
- Derivative of main e-CF spec
- Lower impact individually

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours total
